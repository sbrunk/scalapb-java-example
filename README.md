# ScalaPB Scala and Java example
Example project that uses [ScalaPB](https://trueaccord.github.io/ScalaPB/) and plain
[sbt-protobuf](https://github.com/sbt/sbt-protobuf) side-by-side to generate Android compatible Java Code as well as
Scala code from the same proto files.

Shows how to use ScalaPB options in shared proto files (i.e. for custom Scala types) without affecting the generated
Java code.
